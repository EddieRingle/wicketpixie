1) copy the folder kontera into wp-content/plugins in your wordpress installation.
2) On your wordpress administration pages, navigate to 'Plugins' and hit Activate next to the 'Kontera ContentLink' plugin entry.
3) Still in the administration pages, navigate to the 'Setting' page, and choose the newly created submenu 'Kontera Settings'.
   You can select category names (separated by commas) where the Kontera ContentLink code should not be used (and thus hide the ContentLinks). This option is referred as 'Block ContentLink from categories'. Category names are case insensitive.
