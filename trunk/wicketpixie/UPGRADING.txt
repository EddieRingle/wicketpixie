UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

If you are upgrading from WicketPixie 1.0.1 or 1.0, you'll need to delete the
WicketPixie plugins from /wp-content/plugins/ and also delete the
/wp-content/uploads/activity/ folder. You will not have to do this with any
version of WicketPixie newer than 1.0.1.

Before upgrading to any new version of WicketPixie, save your home.php unless
otherwise stated here. Please do not save any other file that may get
overwritten by the new version as there may be important updates required by
the WicketPixie installation.
