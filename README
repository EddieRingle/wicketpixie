INSTALLING

Just place the wicketpixie folder in your /wp-content/themes/ directory and
then activate the theme. Then make sure the httpd user has write access to
the widgets folder and it's contents (chmod 0777) and the app folder
(chmod 0777). Remember, if your web server uses the same user that owns
the wicketpixie files, there is no need to change permissions.
