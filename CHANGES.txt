WICKETPIXIE CHANGELOG

WORKING - TBA, 2009
 * FEATURE: The Custom Header feature allows you to add custom code to
 header.php without modifying it yourself. The code is included within the
 <head></head> tags.
 * ADDED: WicketPixie has it's own top-level menu in WordPress' admin area.
 * PERFORMANCE: We are using Google to serve jQuery and favicons, so page load
 times will have decreased.
 * PERFORMANCE: Status update caching caches the latest feed item from the
 designated source for status updates. If the cache is older than 45 seconds,
 a new cache is built.
 * UPDATED: Twitter post will show "from WicketPixie" now after you publish
 a blog post and have Twitter set to be notified by WicketPixie.
 * UPDATED: @<username here> in status updates will now link to that user's
 Twitter profile, if Twitter is set to provide the updates of course.
 * UPDATED: Made the search highlight plugin optional.
 * FIXED: Checkboxes in WicketPixie Options will remember their settings.

v1.0.4 - January 19, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * FEATURE: Plain-text URLs in the Status Updates box are now hyperlinked,
 now only one click is required for visitors.
 * FEATURE: WicketPixie Services Notification System. Basically, when a
 user publishes a blog post, Ping.fm or Twitter, depending on what the
 user setup, is notified and a link to that blog post is sent out.
 * FIXED: Fixed a few CSS issues

v1.0.3 - January 7, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * FEATURE: Now only the wicketpixie folder is required, and everything
 has been either automated or moved into the theme folder,
 making things much easier on the user.
 * ADDED: Added a footer notice in the admin area including the current
 version of WicketPixie.
 * PERFORMANCE: More UI improvements, now the all the admin pages WicketPixie
 adds load much faster and do not halt in the middle of loading.
 * UPDATED: Updated SimplePie version.

v1.0.2 - January 4, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * FEATURE: UI improvements to certain WicketPixie forms. For example,
 if a source has no feed associated, it will show "N/A" on the
 Sources Manager page. Also, you can't flush non-feed streams,
 so the buttons to flush them have been removed.
 * UPDATED: Updated Source Manager and Faves Manager for Wordpress 2.7+
 as well as leaving it backwards compatible with Wordpress 2.5+
 * FIXED: Fixed the activity stream, it now shows your activity stream!
v1.0.1 - June 8, 2008
