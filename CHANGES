WICKETPIXIE CHANGELOG

v1.1 - April 18, 2009
 * FEATURE: Global Announcements allow you to set a message that is displayed
 globally across your site.
 * FEATURE: The Home Editor lets you modify important parts of your homepage
 without ever touching the template itself.
 * FEATURE: Those nifty social buttons? Yeah, we threw those in too. ;-)
 * FEATURE: The Custom Code feature allows you to add custom code to
 header.php, footer.php, and after post content without modifying the template
 yourself.
 * FEATURE: Adsense Integration allows you insert Adsense ads in the
 recommended areas without touching the templates.
 * PLUGIN: Numerous plugins have been added:
 All-in-one SEO pack, AskApache 404, Auto-hyperlink URLs, Chitika Premium,
 FAlbum, Kontera, Obfuscate Email, PageNavi, and StatPress Reloaded
 * PLUGIN: Updated Related Posts plugin to version 1.0.
 * ADDED: WicketPixie has it's own top-level menu in WordPress' admin area.
 There is also a top-level menu for the plugins bundled with WicketPixie.
 * ADDED: On the homepage and on single posts, a new ReTweet widget is shown
 along with the number of Tweets linking to that post and a retweet button.
 * PERFORMANCE: We are using Google to serve jQuery and favicons, so page load
 times will have decreased.
 * PERFORMANCE: Status update caching caches the latest feed item from the
 designated source for status updates. If the cache is older than 45 seconds,
 a new cache is built.
 * UPDATED: Twitter post will show "from WicketPixie" now after you publish
 a blog post and have Twitter set to be notified by WicketPixie.
 * UPDATED: @{username here} in status updates will now link to that user's
 Twitter profile, if Twitter is set to provide the updates of course.
 * UPDATED: Made the search highlight plugin optional.
 * FIXED: Checkboxes in WicketPixie Options will remember their settings.
 * FIXED: Nofollow has been added to header and navigational links for better
 SEO.
 * FIXED: Appended UNIX timestamp to the end of CSS files to prevent caching.
 * FIXED: Many other bugs :P

 * FEATURE: Plain-text URLs in the Status Updates box are now hyperlinked,
 now only one click is required for visitors.
 * FEATURE: WicketPixie Services Notification System. Basically, when a
 user publishes a blog post, Ping.fm or Twitter, depending on what the
 user setup, is notified and a link to that blog post is sent out.
 * FIXED: Fixed a few CSS issues

v1.0.3 - January 7, 2009 by Eddie Ringle

 has been either automated or moved into the theme folder,
 making things much easier on the user.

 version of WicketPixie.
 * PERFORMANCE: More UI improvements, now the all the admin pages WicketPixie
 adds load much faster and do not halt in the middle of loading.
 * UPDATED: Updated SimplePie version.

v1.0.2 - January 4, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * FEATURE: UI improvements to certain WicketPixie forms. For example,
 if a source has no feed associated, it will show "N/A" on the
 Sources Manager page. Also, you can't flush non-feed streams,
 so the buttons to flush them have been removed.
 * UPDATED: Updated Source Manager and Faves Manager for Wordpress 2.7+
 as well as leaving it backwards compatible with Wordpress 2.5+
 * FIXED: Fixed the activity stream, it now shows your activity stream!
v1.0.1 - June 8, 2008
